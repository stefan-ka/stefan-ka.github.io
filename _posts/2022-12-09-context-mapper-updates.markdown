Great news for all who missed [mine](/about) and [Olaf Zimmermann](https://ozimmer.ch)'s [JavaSPEKTRUM article from last year](/2021/12/17/java-spektrum-article/) and/or
wanted to read about our experiences with [Context Mapper](https://contextmapper.org/) in English! 

We recently published two translated blogposts that cover the contents of the original article 
«Domain-Driven Design in der Praxis - Erfahrungen mit dem Open-Source-Tool Context Mapper» written in German. Check it out: 🙌

 * [Part by me](https://blog.mimacom.com/ddd-and-context-mapper-experience/) (published on [mimacom](https://www.mimacom.com/)'s blog)
 * [Part by Olaf Zimmermann (OST)](https://ozimmer.ch/modeling/2022/11/23/ContextMapperInsights.html)

Many thanks to [Olaf Zimmermann](https://ozimmer.ch) and [mimacom](https://www.mimacom.com/) for the nice collaboration and the support! 🙏🏻

Additional great news: We finally released a [new version of Context Mapper that is compatible with Java 17](https://contextmapper.org/news/2022/12/02/v6.7.0-released/) 🥳
That really took some time and effort; thanks to all the users who had the patience to wait for this one 😉 

Best,
Stefan
