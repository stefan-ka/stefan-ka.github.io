Together with my colleague [Olaf Zimmermann](https://ozimmer.ch) ([University of Applied Sciences of Eastern Switzerland - OST](https://www.ost.ch)) 
I wrote an article for the [latest JavaSPEKTRUM](https://webreader.javaspektrum.de/de/profiles/4967c6d5eae1-javaspektrum/editions/javaspektrum-06-2021) (German!).

The topic: our experiences with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and our open source modeling tool [Context Mapper](https://contextmapper.org/) in projects. 
From my side I also share some insights about how we applied DDD and used the tool in [mimacom](https://www.mimacom.com/)'s [smartIFU](https://smartifu.com/) 
project for [Paul Büetiger AG](https://www.buetiger.ch/).

For all who are interested in the topic - here you can find the PDF of our article:

Feedback is always welcome of course 🙂

Many thanks to [mimacom](https://www.mimacom.com/) for supporting us with this article! 🙏🏻

Best,
