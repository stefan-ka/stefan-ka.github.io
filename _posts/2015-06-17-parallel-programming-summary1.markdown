We work with Java, but the principles can be transfered to other languages.

## Parallelism vs. Concurrency
There are often confusions with the terms 'Parallelism' and 'Concurrency'.
This terms actually mean not the same, but they are two aspects of the same principle.

**Parallelism** basically means the splitting up of a process in simultaneously executable and collaborating sub-processes.

**Concurrency** means that two processes can start, run, and complete in overlapping time periods. 
They are independant but they compete for shared resources.

## Multithreading basics

### Process vs. Thread 
A **Process** is a heavy weight program instance. Each process has his own address space.

A **Thread** in contrast is a light weight parallel program instance inside a process. Threads share the same address space.

### Create a thread in Java

Implement a thread in java:
{% highlight java %}
class SimpleThread extends Thread {
   @Override
   publicvoidrun() {
      // threadbehavior
   }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Create thread instance:
{% highlight java %}
Thread myThread= newSimpleThread();
{% endhighlight %}

Start the thread:
{% highlight java %}
myThread.start();
{% endhighlight %}

A real thread is started only if you call the *start()* method. 
The *start()* method calls the *run()* method of the thread.
If a thread throws an unhandled exception, all other threads are still running.

### Runnable Interface
As an alternative to extend the class *Thread*, you can implement the *Runnable* interface.
{% highlight java %}
class SimpleLogic implements Runnable {
   @Override
   public void run() {
      // threadbehavior
   }
}

Thread myThread = newThread(newSimpleLogic());

myThread.start();
{% endhighlight %}

### Shorter with Java 8 Lambda
Ad-Hoc implementation of a 1-Method interface:
{% highlight java %}
Thread myThread = newThread(() -> {
   // threadbehavior
});

myThread.start();
{% endhighlight %}

### Anonymous inner class
{% highlight java %}
void startMyThread(final String label, final intnofIt) {
   newThread() {
      @Override public void run() {
         for (int i = 0; i < nofIt; i++) {
            System.out.println(i + " " + label);
         }
      }
   }.start();
}
â€¦
startMyThread("A", 10);
startMyThread("B", 10);
{% endhighlight %}

### Thread methods

With **Thread.sleep(milliseconds)** you can put a thread in the waiting state. After *milliseconds* he will go to ready state again.

**Thread.yield()** forces the thread to release the processor. (forces thread switch)

**Thread.join()** blocks until the thread is terminated. After a thread is terminated *t.isAlive()* will be *false*.

### InterruptedException

 - It's possible that blocking methods (*sleep()*, *join()*) throw an InterruptedException
 - Threads can be interrupted from outside: *myThread.interrupt()*

## Monitor synchronization
Threads have to share their address space and heap. They can access same objects and variables.
That's why access to resources have to be synchronized enough, otherwise race conditions are possible. (uncontrolled or wrong interactions between threads)

### Critical Section
Methods or code blocks which should be executed by only one thread at one time are called **Critical sections**.
No parallel execution should be possible for this sections. (mutual exclusion)

### Java Synchronized Methods
With the *synchronized* modifier, the body of a method is marked as *critical section*:
{% highlight java %}
class BankAccount {
   private intbalance = 0;

   public synchronized void deposit(int amount) {
      this.balance += amount;
   }
}
{% endhighlight %}

**How does *synchronized* work?**<br />
Each object has a lock (monitor lock) and only one thread at a time
can have this lock. If a thread enter's a synchronized block he takes the lock if it's free.
Otherwise he has to wait until the lock gets free.

If you add the synchronized modifier to multiple methods in the class, only one thread can enter one of this methods at one time.

### Synchronized Statement Blocks
With synchronized statement blocks you can mark critical sections inside methods.
Additionally you can define the Lock-Object explicitly.

In this example we make a monitor lock on *this*:
{% highlight java %}
class BankAccount {
   private intbalance = 0;

   public void deposit(int amount) {
      synchronized(this) {
         this.balance += amount;
      }
      System.out.println("Deposit done");
   }
}
{% endhighlight %}

#### Equivalent usage
The following example ...
{% highlight java %}
public class Test {
   synchronized void f() { ... } // Object Lock
   static synchronized void g () { ... } // Class Lock
}
{% endhighlight %}

... is equal to ...

{% highlight java %}
public class Test {
   void f() {
      synchronized(this) { ... } // Object Lock
   }
   
   static void g() {
      synchronized(Test.class) { ... } // Class Lock
   }
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Wait & Signal Mechanism
With the *Wait & Signal* mechanism threads can wait for conditions.
Threads can also signal other threads to wake up.

 - *wait()* releases the monitor lock temporary. Thread is inactive until wakeup.
 - *notify()* wakes a specific thread
 - *notifyAll()* wakes all threads which are waiting for entering the monitor
 
Example:
{% highlight java %}
class BoundedBuffer<T> {
   private Queue<T> queue = new LinkedList<>();
   int limit; // initialize in constructor

   public synchronized void put(T x) throws InterruptedException {
      while(queue.size() == limit) {
         wait(); // await non-full
      }
      queue.add(x);
      notifyAll(); // signal non-empty
   }

   public synchronized T get() throws InterruptedException {
      while (queue.size() == 0) {
         wait(); // await non-empty
      }
      T x = queue.remove();
      notifyAll(); // signal non-full
      return x;
   }
}
{% endhighlight %}

#### Efficiency problem
 - With multiple conditions
    - *notifyAll()* wakes all threads
    - all threads enter monitor one after another
    - condition maybe only for one thread fulfilled
    - all other threads call *wait()* again
 - context switches
 - high synchronization costs

#### Fairness Problem
In Java you cannot be sure that you have a FIFO queue, so it's
possible that you have threads which never wake up. (reason to use *notifyAll()*)

## Specific Synchronization Primitives

### Semaphore
A semaphore is an object with a counter that counts the amount of free resources.
With the *acquire()* method you can get one resource and the counter decrements.
*release()* passes the resource back and the counter increments.

![Semaphore](/media/062015-parallel-programming-summary1-semaphore.png)

**A semaphore with a counter which can only be 0 or 1 is called *Binary Semaphore*.**

#### Fair semaphore
By default the semaphore in Java is not fair.
If you like a fair semaphore you have to pass an additional parameter to the constructor:
{% highlight java %}
new Semaphore(N, true)
{% endhighlight %}
In this case the semaphore uses a FIFO queue.

#### Multi-Acquire/Release
You can also acquire and release multiple resources:
{% highlight java %}
acquire(int permits)

release(int permits)
{% endhighlight %}

### Lock & Conditions {#lock-and-conditions}
The *Lock & Conditions* primitive is basically a monitor with multiple waiting lists for different conditions.

 - Lock-Object: Lock for entering monitor
 - Condition-Object: Wait & Signal for conditions
 - Multiple conditions per lock possible

![Lock & Conditions](/media/062015-parallel-programming-summary1-lock-and-condition.png)

Example:
{% highlight java %}
class BoundedBuffer<T> {
   private Queue<T> queue = new LinkedList<>();
   private Lock monitor = new ReentrantLock(true);
   private Condition nonFull = monitor.newCondition();
   private Condition nonEmpty = monitor.newCondition();   
   
   public void put(T item) throws InterruptedException {
      monitor.lock();
      try {
         while (queue.size() == Capacity) { 
            nonFull.await(); 
         }
         queue.add(item);
         nonEmpty.signal();
      } finally { 
         monitor.unlock(); 
      }
   }

   public T get() throws InterruptedException {
      monitor.lock();
      try {
         while (queue.size() == 0) { 
            nonEmpty.await(); 
         }
         T item = queue.remove();
         nonFull.signal();
         return item;
      } finally { 
         monitor.unlock(); 
      }
   }
}
{% endhighlight %}

#### Read-Write Lock
Mutual exclusion often is not needed for read access but for write access.
In this case you can use ReadWrite-Locks.

Example:
{% highlight java %}
class NameDatabase {
   private Collection<String> names = new HashSet<>();
   private ReadWriteLock rwLock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock(true);

   public Collection<String> find(String pattern) {
      rwLock.readLock().lock();
      try {
         return names.stream().
            filter(n -> n.matches(pattern));
      } finally {
         rwLock.readLock().unlock();
      }
   }

   public void put(String name) {
      rwLock.writeLock().lock();
      try {
         names.add(name);
      } finally {
         rwLock.writeLock().unlock();
      }
   }
}
{% endhighlight %}

**ReadWriteLocks with conditions:** Conditions are supported for WriteLocks only!

### Count Down Latch
A *count down latch* is a synchronization primitive with a counter.
This is used if all threads wait for one single condition. When the condition is fulfilled, all threads will work further.
The counter can be decremented by threads with the method *countDown()*.
Threads can wait until the counter is zero with the *await()* method.

Example:
All Cars have to wait for the startSignal.
And the startSignal must wait until all cars are ready.
{% highlight java %}
CountDownLatch carsReady = new CountDownLatch(N);
CountDownLatch startSignal = new CountDownLatch(1);

N Cars:                                     RaceControl:
carsReady.countDown(); -------------------> carsReady.await();
startSignal.await(); <--------------------- startSignal.countDown();

{% endhighlight %}

Latches can only be used once. You cannot reset the counter.
If you need a new synchronization you have to create a new latch.

### Cyclic Barrier

 - A cyclic barrier is a meeting point for a fixed amount of threads. The threads can wait until all other threads arrived. (*await()*)
 - The amount of threads must be defined from beginning.
 - Cyclic Barrier's are re-usable
 
The barrier closes automatically for next round:
{% highlight java %}
CyclicBarrier gameRound = new CyclicBarrier(N);

while (true) {
   gameRound.await();
   // play concurrently with others
}
{% endhighlight %}
![Cyclic Barrier](/media/062015-parallel-programming-summary1-barrier.png)

### Phaser
 - is a generalized cyclic barrier
 - participants can register and de-register (effective in next round)
 
Player-Thread:
{% highlight java %}
phaser.register();
while (â€¦) {
   phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
   playRound();
}
phaser.arriveAndDeregister();
{% endhighlight %}

### Rendez-Vous
 - barrier with information exchange
 - special case: 2 participants
 - 2 threads meet und exchange objects
 
### Exchanger
 - blocks, until other thread calls *exchange()*
 - provides argument x of the other thread

![Exchanger](/media/062015-parallel-programming-summary1-exchanger.png)

## Risks of concurrency
What are possible problems if we have concurrency?

 - Race conditions
      - Not enough synchronization
 - Deadlocks
      - mutual exclusion of threads
 - Starvation
      - fairness problems

### Race conditions
Race conditions leads to unexpected behaviors because multiple threads access shared resources without enough synchronization.
There are two different levels of race conditions:

 - data races (low-level)
 - semantically higher race conditions (high-level)
 
A program with race conditions is incorrect. There can be errors from time to time, but they are usually very hard to find.

#### Data races
Data races happen if threads access shared variables or objects and there is at least one writing access. (Read-Write, Write-Read, Write-Write)

#### Semantically higher race conditions
 - Critical sections not protected
      - Low-Level data races eliminated with synchronization
      - But not big enough synchronized blocks

### Should we synchronize everything?
It does not help if we just synchronize all methods. 
There can be semantically higher race conditions anyway and the synchronization is very expensive. (costs)

**When isn't synchronization needed?**

 - Immutability
      - Objects with read access only and final variables
 - Confinement
      - Object belongs only to one thread 

#### Immutable objects
 - all variables are *final*
 - methods with read access only
 - after constructor object can be used without synchronization (at least in java)
 
#### Confinement
Structure guarantees that object is only accessed by one thread at same time.
 
 - Thread confinement
      - Object is referenced from one thread
 - Object confinement
      - Object is encapsulated in an already synchronized object

### Thread safety
What means *thread safety*?

 - classes / methods which are synchronized internally
      - no data races
      - critical sections only inside methods
 - But:
      - Semantically higher race conditions still possible
      - other concurrency problems possible
 - There is no clear definition of this term

### Java collections and thread safety
Old java collections (Java 1.0) like *Vector, Stack, Hashtable* are threadsafe.
Modern collections (java.util > 1.0) like *HashSet, TreeSet, ArrayList, LinkedList, HashMap or TreeMap* are not threadsafe.
If you need concurrent collections, use classes in *java.util.concurrent*. (*ConcurrentHashMap, ConcurrentLinkedQueue, CopyOnWriteArrayList, ...*)

Why are the modern collections in java.util not threadsafe anymore?

 - often synchronization isn't needed => confinement
 - synchronization is mostly insufficient => elements not synchronized
 - old java 1.0 collections are historically threadsafe (backward compatibility)
 
#### Synchronized wrappers
It's also possible to use wrappers which synchronizes all methods. The elements are still not synchronized! (available for *List, Set, Collection, SortedList, SortedSet*)
{% highlight java %}
List list = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList());
{% endhighlight %}

#### Iterating with concurrency
Iteration of a synchronized collection is not synchronized completely. Only single accesses are synchronized.
It's still possible that another thread changes the collection parallel to your iteration. (semantically higher race conditions)

### Nested Locks
Nested locks can lead to **deadlocks**. Example:

**Thread 1:**
{% highlight java %}
synchronized(listA) {
  synchronized(listB) {
    listB.addAll(listA);
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
**Thread 2:**
{% highlight java %}
synchronized(listB) {
  synchronized(listA) {
    listA.addAll(listB);
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
**What's the problem here?**
In the worst case, thread 2 will lock *listB* directly after thread 1 locked *listA*.
That scenario will block both threads because thread 1 is waiting for *listB* and thread 1 for *listA*. 

Programs with potential **Deadlocks** are incorrect:
 
 - threads can block each other
 - errors can happen sporadically 
 - difficult to find through tests
 
#### Special case: Livelocks
If threads block each other permanently but still use CPU, this is called livelock.
Example: 

**Thread 1:**
{% highlight java %}
b = false;
while (!a) { sleep(1); }
{% endhighlight %}
**Thread 2:**
{% highlight java %}
a = false;
while (!b) { sleep(1); }
{% endhighlight %}

###Starvation
Starvation means that a thread never gets a chance to access a resource.

 - while the resource again and again gets free (it's always another thread which gets it)
 - other threads overtake him
 
Starvation is a liveness / fairness problem:

 - threads have to wait for undefined time
 - exceptions can happen sporadically, or not
 - very hard to find through tests
 
How to avoid starvation?

 - use fair synchronization constructs
    - give threads which had to wait longer more priority
    - enable fairness in Java Semaphore's, Lock & Condition and Read-Write-Lock's
 - Remember: Java Monitor has fairness problems and is very susceptible to starvation
    - Starvation is also possible if you set thread priority
